# `cv/`

This is a Typst document that compiles a PDF of my CV. This should be built as part of my website, so there is always an up-to-date version available.

## Git submodule

The `alta-typst/` folder is a submodule, as I didn't want to duplicate the CV template.

On a fresh clone, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull the submodule.

To update the submodule to reflect upstream, run `git submodule update --remote --recursive`.
