I'm going to use this blog to write about random things I care about. It may or may not turn out well -- it must have gone at least a little well if you are reading this.

For anyone interested, this website is created using Hugo, which is a static site generator. I used to have a blog made using Wordpress, which was a bit overkill for my needs and I got bored of writing stuff for it about a month in, so it died the slow death that I'm sure this one will have to endure. Hugo seems to be a much more elegant solution for this, and I like being able to write all my stuff in VSCode, keep it safe in my own git repo, and avoid having to host *another* database.

To be fair to Wordpress, setting it up when I was 15 was a good learning experience. I somehow managed to fumble through the instructions, probably leaving some fairly large security holes behind me. I think a version of it might still be in the Wayback Machine if you ever have the unpleasant experience of stumbling upon it.

We'll see where this goes I guess ~
