I study at Royal Holloway, a university probably most well known for the iconic Founder's Building. According to Wikipedia, it is an example of French-Renaissance style architecture. Founder's is often used in TV and film as visual shorthand for a grandiose university or school setting, starring in Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Crown, You, and most importantly, Midsomer Murders [^1].

[^1]: The Crown and You were filming recently, so I don't have any sources (bar campus rumours). Royal Holloway has an [official page](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/about-us/our-history/our-story/in-tv-and-film/) listing previous productions.

On the wooded slopes below Founder's is Jane Holloway Hall. It was built in 1893, so about a decade after Founder's was finished. It is not nearly as visually impressive, but suits its environment well enough. Saying that, they decided to pebble dash it, which I think is a bad call on _any_ building.
For almost as long as I've been at Royal Holloway, I've been curious about this building. There isn't much about it online. On campus there are vague rumours that a student once drowned there. There are a few ancient posts on Student Room..
