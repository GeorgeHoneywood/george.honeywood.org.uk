## the problem

One of the most satisfying things for me, as a contributor to OSM, is to see how my changes have improved the map for everyone. There currently are a number of ways to achieve this, which primarily focus on the micro level, for example a single changeset (such as [OSMCha](https://osmcha.org)). These are very useful for checking for things like vandalism, and simply just showing what that changeset did to nodes, ways & relations. On the other hand, I've yet to find something that lets me see what has happened in an area over a greater time period.

## the goal

An ideal world, I can picture a screen with two maps, with one overlaid on the other, each with a date picker. There would be a slider which can be moved from one side to the other to show the differences between them. This layout is inspired by the currently out of service [OSM Then and Now](https://mvexel.github.io/thenandnow/), which goes some of the way towards a solution, but the data shown is too old to be useful for me.

## a partial solution
